## About Me
Three years ago, I entered the university at the Faculty of Computer Technology. For a long time I did not know in which particular direction I want to develop. Half a year ago, I became interested in web development. During this time, I learned the basics of layout and JavaScript. At the moment, my goal is to pass all three stages at RS school and become a Junior Frontend Developer.
At RS school I want to get more practice, learn new technologies and meet new people.
